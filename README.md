# Banking-system
This is a simple C++ Banking Program that allows users to check their balance, deposit money, and withdraw money via a menu-driven interface. It validates inputs to prevent negative deposits and insufficient withdrawals. The program uses functions for modularity and displays the balance with two decimal precision.
